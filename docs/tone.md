# Zout ⚽ — Tone & Copy Guide

## Purpose

This document defines how Zout *speaks*.

The goal is consistency.
Menus, prompts, scores, audio cues, and UI copy should all feel like
they belong to the same game.

If the copy breaks immersion, it’s wrong.

---

## Core Tone

Zout is:

- Confident, not loud
- Playful, not goofy
- Focused, not sterile
- Emotional, not dramatic

Zout never begs for attention.
It lets the moment speak.

---

## Voice Principles (Non-Negotiable)

### 1. Say less

Short lines beat explanations.

Good:

- “Ready.”
- “One shot.”
- “Again.”

Bad:

- “Get ready to take your next attempt.”
- “Try again to improve your score.”

---

### 2. Speak like the game knows football

Assume the player understands the culture.

Good:

- “Top bins.”
- “One chance.”
- “Clean.”

Bad:

- “Upper corner bonus!”
- “Perfect accuracy achieved!”

---

### 3. Confidence over hype

No shouting. No emojis mid-sentence unless intentional.

Good:

- “Zout.”
- “No chance.”
- “That felt right.”

Bad:

- “LET’S GOOOO!”
- “AMAZING SHOT!!!”

---

### 4. Let silence do work

Not every action needs text or audio.

If the strike says everything,
the UI stays quiet.

---

## Language Rules

### Allowed

- Football language
- Short declarative sentences
- Calm affirmations
- Commentator-style phrasing

### Avoid

- Gamer slang
- Tutorials in disguise
- Corporate tone
- Excessive numbers on screen

---

## Core Vocabulary (Canonical)

These words have **specific meaning** in Zout.
Do not remix them casually.

- **Zout** → Called when the ball goes in
- **Top Bins** → Goal placed in the top corner
- **Clean** → Solid execution
- **Scuffed** → Poor execution
- **Perfect** → Internal contact quality (not always announced)

---

## UI Copy Examples

### Menus

- “Practice”
- “Penzie”
- “Free Kick”
- “Settings”
- “Again”

No subtitles. No explanations.

---

### Shot Feedback (Minimal)

- “Zout.”
- “Top bins.”
- “Clean.”
- “Wide.”
- “Saved.”

Never stack more than one line unless intentional.

---

### Mode Intros

**Practice**
> “No pressure. Find the feel.”

**Penzie**
> “One shot.”

**Free Kick**
> “All eyes on you.”

---

## Scoring Copy

Numbers are secondary.
Words come first.

Good:

- “+100”
- “Top bins +50”

Bad:

- “Accuracy Bonus Applied”
- “Perfect Timing Multiplier”

---

## Audio Copy Rules

Voice lines are:

- short
- calm
- rare

Examples:

- “Zout.”
- “Perfect.”
- “No chance.”

Never repeat voice lines back-to-back.
Silence is a feature.

---

## Emotional Arc per Shot

1. Quiet setup  
2. Rising tension  
3. Impact  
4. Outcome  
5. Release or reset  

Copy should **follow this arc**, not interrupt it.

---

## Final Check (Use This Before Adding Any Copy)

Ask:

- Does this add clarity or emotion?
- Would a real commentator say this?
- Can this be shorter?
- Would silence be better?

If unsure, remove it.

---

## Summary

Zout speaks with restraint.

It trusts the player.
It trusts the moment.
It never overexplains.

If the strike is good,
the copy steps aside.

That’s the tone.
