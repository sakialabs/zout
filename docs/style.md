# Zout ⚽ — Visual Design Guide

## Visual Goal

Make every strike feel **inevitable**.

Zout visuals are calm, confident, and focused.
Nothing distracts from the moment the ball meets the net.

If it doesn’t serve the strike, it doesn’t exist.

---

## Creative Direction

**Minimal realism, football-first.**

Zout sits between:

- the raw honesty of street football
- the drama of a big stadium moment

No flash.
No spectacle for spectacle’s sake.
Just intention.

Think:

- clean frames
- strong contrast
- quiet confidence

## Color Palette (Locked)

### Core Colors

These appear everywhere.

- **Pitch Green**  
  `#2E5E4E`  
  Muted, grounded, never neon.

- **Ball White**  
  `#F4F4F2`  
  Clean, readable, slightly warm.

- **Net White**  
  `#E8E6E1`  
  Softer than the ball, avoids harsh contrast.

---

### Accent Colors

Used **sparingly**.

- **Zout Glow (💫)**  
  `#F5E6A8`  
  Warm, soft gold.  
  Used only on Zout moments.

- **Top Bins Highlight (🎯)**  
  `#DDE9F5`  
  Cool, sharp white-blue.  
  Used only on top corner goals.

- **UI Slate**  
  `#1E1F22`  
  Backgrounds, overlays, menus.

- **UI Gray**  
  `#9CA3AF`  
  Secondary text, subtle indicators.

---

### Hard Rules

- No saturated reds or blues during gameplay
- No gradients unless tied to lighting
- Accents never compete with the ball

---

## Lighting Direction

Lighting does the storytelling.

### General Rules

- Ball is always clearly lit
- Goal mouth slightly brighter than surroundings
- Backgrounds fall off into softness

### Environments

- **Street:** side lighting, harder shadows
- **Park:** even daylight, soft contrast
- **Cage:** enclosed light, tighter highlights
- **Stadium:** strong overhead lights, darker crowd

---

## Camera Language

The camera is a silent commentator.

### Default

- Calm
- Centered behind the ball
- Respectful distance

### Power Charge

- Subtle push-in
- No rotation

### Strike

- Micro shake (very small)
- No zoom

### Zout

- Tiny slow-motion beat
- Camera holds
- UI disappears briefly

### Top Bins

- Same as Zout
- Slight emphasis toward the corner
- One extra frame of hold

No spins.  
No whip pans.  
No showing off.

---

## Ball & Player

### Ball

The ball is the hero.

- Slightly larger than realistic for readability
- Clean texture with visible seams
- Always high contrast against background

### Player

- Minimal early on
- Legs or silhouette preferred
- Animation clarity > animation complexity

You don’t need a full player model to feel football.

---

## Environments

Zout lives anywhere football is played.

### Streets

- Concrete, fences, rough edges
- Tight framing
- Raw and honest

### Parks

- Open space
- Natural light
- Calm energy

### Cages

- Enclosed space
- Close walls
- Intimate pressure

### Stadiums

- Clean geometry
- Crowd as a mass, not individuals
- Lights carry the drama

Same rules.  
Different pressure.

---

## UI Design

UI should **whisper**, not talk.

### Principles

- Thin lines
- Simple shapes
- Few elements at once
- Fade in, fade out

If players stare at UI, the design failed.

---

## Power & Timing UI

- Clean bars
- No sparks or particles
- Sweet spot subtly marked
- Centered and readable

UI should guide instinct, not demand attention.

---

## Typography

- One primary sans-serif font
- Neutral, modern, readable
- No decorative fonts

Text behavior:

- Appears briefly
- Never stacks
- Often fades instead of slides

“Zout.”  
Then silence.

---

## Zout Moment (💫 Visual Signature)

This is sacred.

When Zout happens:

- Soft glow on ball or net
- Micro slow-motion
- Camera holds
- UI disappears

It should feel like:
“Yeah… that was it.”

---

## Top Bins Moment (🎯)

Top bins stacks on Zout.

Visual cues:

- Net ripple emphasized
- Slight corner framing
- No extra effects

Clean.
Sharp.
Recognizable.

---

## What to Avoid (Non-Negotiable)

- Flashy goal explosions
- Confetti or fireworks
- Cartoon particles
- Emoji during gameplay
- Over-animated crowds
- Constant score popups

Zout earns attention by restraint.

---

## Visual North Star

If someone sees **one still frame** and thinks:

“That strike looks serious.”

You nailed it.
