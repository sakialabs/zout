feat: Add visual polish - building shadows, tree depth, and timing fix

Environment Enhancements:
- Building shadows now match base colors (darker shades of brown/beige/gray)
- Added 8 background trees with lighter colors for depth perception
- Created 3 tree material variations (shadowed/lit/normal) for visual depth
- Trees behind others use darker greens to show layering

Gameplay Fix:
- Increased zout delay from 0.1s to 0.4s so ball visually enters goal first

Technical:
- building_shadows.gd: Dynamic shadow color generation from building materials
- practice_mode.tscn: TreeB1-B8 added at Z:58-75 with distant materials
- feedback_manager.gd: ZOUT_AUDIO_DELAY adjusted to 0.4s
